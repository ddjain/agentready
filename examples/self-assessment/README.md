## How to Run Your Own Assessment

```bash
# Install AgentReady
pip install agentready

# Run assessment on current directory
agentready assess .

# Run with verbose output
agentready assess . --verbose

# Specify output directory
agentready assess /path/to/repo --output-dir ./reports
```

## Next Steps for AgentReady Repository

Based on this assessment, the highest-priority improvements are:

1. **Add Pre-commit Hooks** (+3 points) - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with formatters and linters
2. **Enforce Conventional Commits** (+1.5 points) - Add commitlint to pre-commit hooks

These two changes would bring the score from **75.4** to **79.9** (still Gold, but closer to Platinum threshold of 90).

## About This Assessment

This self-assessment demonstrates:

- ✅ The tool successfully assesses itself
- ✅ All three report formats are generated
- ✅ Assessment completes in under 1 second
- ✅ Provides actionable remediation guidance
- ✅ Accurately reflects repository state

The fact that AgentReady achieves **Gold certification** when assessing itself validates that the scoring algorithm and attribute definitions are reasonable and achievable for real-world repositories.
